public class Player : MonoBehaviour {
	/* Handles most of the "player" stuff
	 * 
	 * Should work just by placing it onto an object that also has a Player script attached.
	 * 
	 * // Variables
	 * isHuman				// Is the player a isHuman or a computer?
	 * 
	 * // Functions
	 * IsControlLocked()	// Check if the player's controls are locked
	 * SetControlLocked(bool)	// Locks/unlocks controls
	 * 
	 * To Do:
	 *	The camera should be handled by a seperate script.
	 *	Record keeping should be handled by a seperate script on per-map basis.
	 *		Set best win time to player's best, or 10th place (if no player score on record). Something like "bestWinTime = Records.GetPlayerRecord();"
	 *		Award stars based on completion time. 1 for completing, 2 for under 20 seconds, 3 for under 10
	 *	Replace the "dropAmount" stuff with something that calculates the map's bounds, and resets the player if they manage to escape those bounds
	 *		Possible easter eggs for skilled players?
	 *	Automatically get the player's visible body
	 *	Make player into a prefab that does not collide with other players (potential multiplayer)
